# What is The Second Opinion?
"The Second Opinion" is a collection of **Second Opinion** scanners designed to be portable and easy-to-use. *(Fancy way of saying that it's a zip file of multiple portable AV scanners)*

## What are Second Opinion scanners?
>"Second-opinion scanners are meant to be used when you wish to get a "second opinion," that is, to run a different engine than the one which is currently installed on the computer to see if it finds anything that the installed one did not find. This method is effective due to the diverse methodologies and signature databases employed by different antivirus software, increasing the chances of detecting a wider range of malware, including sophisticated threats that might have evaded the primary antivirus. Second-opinion scanners are particularly useful when the primary antivirus fails to detect a suspected infection, has a high false-positive rate, or when the user simply wants to ensure maximum protection." - [Reddit r/antivirus](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/wiki/index#wiki_second-opinion_scanners)

::: warning NOT USING WINDOWS?
TSO scanners are only for Windows machines. 32-bit and 64-bit are supported.

::: tip MICROSOFT DEFENDER'S OFFLINE SCAN
It is also a pretty good idea to use Windows Defender's Offline scan function. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-offline">Learn more.</a>

I have compiled these tools in a .zip file which you can download [here.](/download.html)

Alternatively, **if you don't trust me**, you can access the links above and download them one-by-one instead.

All of these programs except Malwarebytes Free are portable, which means you do not need to install them.

Keep in mind that you need Administrator privileges to run these tools.

"The Second Opinion" is coined from "The PC Security Channel" on YouTube. Find his stuff [here.](https://www.youtube.com/@pcsecuritychannel)

This project is created so I have a personal link for my tools, in case I lose my thumb drive that contains them.
