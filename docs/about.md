## Like this project?
If you like this project, you can help me by sharing it with your friends who are in need of such tools. I started helping my friends with tech-related problems when I saw the need for it. I didn't have anyone helping me, so I tried learning it on my own. I don't claim to be a tech-wiz or a know-it-all, but I'm sharing what I know, to help others.
