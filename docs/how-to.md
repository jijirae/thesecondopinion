# How-to
Let's get you properly set up!

## Foreword
*This guide assumes that you are a beginner-level user, and have really basic knowledge on computers.*

## Prerequisites
1. A file archiver tool, like [7zip](), or [WinRAR]().
2. A Windows computer.
3. (Optional) A thumb drive.

>[!NOTE]
>This guide assumes that you are using 7-zip.

## Setting up TSO

### 1. Downloading TSO
Head over the ["Download"](/download.html) and choose from the mirrors I have provided.

### 2. Unpacking the archive
Once you have downloaded the file, right-click on the file to see the options for 7-zip. You can either;
- A. Extract to "archive name" to let 7-zip make it's own folder with the name of the archive and all the files included...
- B. or Open the archive and drag-and-drop the files yourself.

The first one is easier because it's always the same place alongside where the archive is placed.

### 3. Running the scanners
Open the folder where you extracted TSO, and you can see multiple .exe files. You are free to run all of them **ONE-BY-ONE**. Don't run all of them at the same time.

Enjoy virus-free life! üëç

::: tip MICROSOFT DEFENDER'S OFFLINE SCAN
It is also a pretty good idea to use Windows Defender's Offline scan function. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-offline">Learn more.</a>

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### *"When should I use \[Scanner\]?*"
You can use them in any order you like.

#### *"Why should I download from you, I can just download all of these for free!"*
Well yeah, that's why I provided download links in the ["What is TSO?"](/what-is.html) page. I only compiled these tools because I'd rather have them stored in a place where I can easily find them, than having to download them all one-by-one. 

#### *"How can I trust that you didn't put any malware in this?"*
I have a good paying job and an actual life. I don't need anything from you, whoever you are. Also, I like helping people.

#### *"That's not a good enough reasoning..."*
